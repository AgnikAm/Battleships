# Structure
### Division of Responsibilities:
Game logic:

* ship.py - Contains class "Ship" that represents a single ship within game.
It contains attributes such as: length, direction, the segments that make it up, as well as information about whether it has already been placed on the board or sunk.

* gameboard.py - Contains class "Gameboard". It provides functionalities for placing ships, performing attacks, tracking hits and misses. Stores information about the board's owner's score.

Graphical Interface:

* menu.py - visual representation of main menu
* rules.py - visual representation of rules screen
* placement.py - visual representation of screen in which player places ships on the board
* game.py - visual representation of game screen
* end.py - visual representation of game over screen
* grid.py - visual representation of game board

Integration:
* app.py - serves as the main entry point for the Battleship game application. Orchestrates the interaction between various components of the game and manages the game's execution flow.

Additional modules:
* component.py - module that encapsulates Pygame's Rect and Surface to simplify drawing.
* drawing.py - module that stores assets and colors as constants. Also includes two drawing functions.
